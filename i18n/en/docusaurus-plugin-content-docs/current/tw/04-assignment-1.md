# 4. Assignment 1: Content planning and development

Suppose you need to describe a product, situation, concept, or process
to a group of non-experts. You decide to develop a one-page document
(300â€“500 words) to explain, inform, or convince your audience
to take a certain action.

First, answer the following questions, and then use your answers to
guide the development of your document.

Use the guiding principles from The Elements of Style to develop your
content. When in doubt about grammar, usage, and style, refer to the
Chicago Manual of Style or another style guide you have access to (see
[Section 3.3](common-styles/compare))

:::info Note
This is an open-ended assignment. Please select a topic you are
interested in or are currently conducting research on.

## A. Content planning questions

1. Who is your audience? Describe them in a few sentences.
2. What do they want to accomplish?
3. What is your goal for providing the content?
4. What constraints do you have?
5. Which style manual or guide do you use as a reference?

## B. Content development

Once you have answered the questions above, develop your content
using a two-step approach:

1. Define the structure of your content and identify the topic of
   each paragraph; and
2. Draft and refine your document by consulting a particular style
   manual or guide.
